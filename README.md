This C program represents a simple food ordering system with a menu-driven interface. The 
program utilizes structures to define food items, hotels with menus, and user information. It 
includes functions for displaying menus, searching for food items, adding items to a user's cart, 
and displaying the cart.In the main function, a sample hotel (Hotel A) and an empty user structure 
are created. The program then presents a menu with various options, such as login, signup, 
searching for food and hotels, adding items to the cart, displaying the cart, placing an order, and 
exiting the program. The user interacts with the system by inputting choices and relevant 
information.The program maintains a loop until the user chooses to exit. It handles user 
authentication, food searches, menu displays, cart management, and order placement. The user's 
cart is reset after an order is placed. The program utilizes basic input/output functions and string 
manipulation for user interactions.Overall, the program provides a basic framework for a food 
ordering system, but it's important to note that it lacks certain features such as persistent storage 
for user accounts and orders, error handling, and a more extensive menu structure. It serves as a 
starting point and can be expanded upon for more robust functionality.




2)INTRODUCTION 
The provided C program is a simple console-based food ordering system. It consists of three main 
structures: FoodItem representing individual food items, Hotel representing a hotel with a menu, 
and User representing a system user. The program enables users to log in or sign up, search for 
food items and hotels, add items to their cart, display the cart, place an order, and exit.The 
displayMenu function prints the menu for a given hotel, and the searchFood function searches for 
a specific food item within a hotel's menu. The addItemToCart function adds a selected item to the 
user's cart, and displayCart displays the contents of the user's cart along with the total cost.The 
main function implements a menu-driven program where users can choose various options based 
on their interaction needs. Options include logging in, signing up, searching for food or hotels, 
adding items to the cart, displaying the cart, placing an order, and exiting the program. The program 
runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.It's worth noting that the program uses simple data 
structures and functions, making it a basic example of a text-based food ordering system. Further 
improvements could involve expanding the functionality, incorporating dynamic memory 
allocation, and enhancing user authentication and error handling.
